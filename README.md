# AviationLogisticSCM

logistics or supply chain management system involving order management, warehouse management, inventory management, 

and transportation management, with various databases and caching layers. The system seems to utilize an API Gateway for handling network calls, possibly secured and load-balanced, and incorporates services like notification distribution, analytics, and reverse logistics.

Project Structure
Your solution could be divided into multiple projects to handle different parts of the system effectively:

1. API Layer (Backend in C# and .NET)
API Gateway: Handles incoming requests and routes them to appropriate services.
Services: Individual services for Order Management, Freight Management, Warehouse Management, etc.
Common: Shared utilities, models, and interfaces used across different services.

2. Client Application (Frontend in React)
public/: Static files like HTML, CSS, images, etc.
src/
components/: Reusable UI components.
services/: Services to interact with the backend APIs.
contexts/: React contexts for global state management.
hooks/: Custom React hooks.
views/: Components that represent entire views/pages.
App.js: Main React application component.
index.js: Entry point for the React application.

3. Shared Library (if needed, for shared code between backend and frontend)
